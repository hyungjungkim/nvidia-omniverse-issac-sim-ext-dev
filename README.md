# Developing an Isaac Sim extension

## Example extensions
1. **Hello Extension**  
This example is configured to test the basics of building a custom extension as a plugin for the Isaac Sim application.

2. **Hello Scene - IExt**  
This example implements setting a default stage using the omni.ext.IExt interface for the Isaac Sim. I made this example by referring to the BaseSample class to understand a basic pipeline to build a scene from an extension.

3. **Hello Scene - BaseSample**  
This example implements setting a default stage using the BaseSample class for the Isaac Sim. In this example, I modified the menu name (in 'base_sample_extension.py') from 'Isaac Examples' to 'Isaac Ext Dev' to distinguish this example from the existing examples.

4. Hello Robot  
In this example, I tested how to add articulated robots, including industrial and collaborative robots.

5. Hello Task  
(to be added.)

6. Hello Sensor - Vision  
(to be added.)

7. Hello Sensor - Lidar?  
(to be added.)

8. (to be determined.)
